Work in progress.

Working on a feature for a project, I needed to parse .gitignore files and halfway through I realized it was way too much to add to someone else's code and I saw the existing libraries dont seem to be maintained regularly and had unresolved issues. This is my own implementation that borrows a little from go_gitignore but is by no means a rewrite or a fork. God knows how you posisbly stumbled on this/are reading this, but if you feel like contributing, go right ahead and submit PR's. I will update this MD by this weekend when it's finished, only after then should you submit issues because it should be incredibly obvious that it does not yet work.
